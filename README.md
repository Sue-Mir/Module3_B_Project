# Module 3 Project - Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods

The main goal of this project is to create a classification model. 

The data analysed were metrics extracted from annual SEC 10K fillings (2012-2016), enough to derive most of popular fundamental indicators.  Prices were fetched from Yahoo Finance, fundamentals are from Nasdaq Financials, extended by some fields from EDGAR SEC databases.

The target to predict was modelling which predictors influenced a positive net cash flow for each company >listed.  This was investigated through Decision Tree and Ensemble Methods.
